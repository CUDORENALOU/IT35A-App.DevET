Target Audience for HungerRelief:

The target audience of the HungerRelief app includes the following groups:

2. Food Surplus Providers ‚Äì Businesses such as restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and households that have excess food and want to donate or sell at a low cost.
3. Local Government Units (LGUs) & Community Leaders ‚Äì Authorities who can support and promote the initiative through policies, logistics, and community engagement.
4. Volunteers & Advocacy Groups ‚Äì Individuals or organizations willing to help with food collection, distribution, and awareness campaigns.

Real-World Context of the Issue Addressed by HungerRelief:

The Badjao community in Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon, struggles with food insecurity because they do not have a stable source of income.
Unlike other Badjao groups who live near the sea and rely on fishing, the Badjao in Manolo Fortich cannot fish since there is no sea. 
Instead, they sell handmade crafts, do small jobs, or ask for help in public places to survive. However, these income sources are not 
enough to provide them with regular meals.

At the same time, a lot of food is wasted daily. Restaurants, grocery stores, and even households throw away extra food that is still safe to eat.
While some people struggle with hunger, large amounts of food go to waste. This shows a big gap between food availability and food access.

The HungerRelief app helps connect food donors with those who need food. By making it easy for businesses and individuals to donate or share surplus food, 
the app ensures that less food is wasted and more people, especially the Badjao, have something to eat. This not only helps reduce hunger but also promotes 
sustainability and responsible food consumption.

5. Research and Evidence for Hunger Relief App

The development of the Hunger Relief app aligns with global food security efforts and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Below are key research sources and evidence supporting the need for such an application.

Food Security and Hunger in the Philippines

According to the World Bank, food insecurity remains a critical challenge in low- and middle-income countries, including the Philippines. 
Inflation in food prices continues to rise, making access to nutritious food difficult for vulnerable populations‚Äã. The four dimensions of 
food security‚Äîavailability, access, utilization, and stability‚Äîare not consistently met in many communities, such as the Badjao in Manolo,
who face challenges due to their displacement from traditional fishing areas‚Äã

Relevance to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
The app contributes primarily to SDG 2: Zero Hunger, which aims to end hunger and improve food security through sustainable solutions. 
The World Bank highlights the importance of food distribution networks in reducing hunger and promoting equitable food access‚Äã by connecting donors 
and recipients, the app helps redistribute surplus food efficiently, preventing waste and ensuring it reaches those in need.
